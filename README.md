**Project Overview:** <br>
This project involves developing a linear regression model to predict taxi fares. The model was built using a sample dataset derived from the<br>
yellow_taxi_fare_dataset, and it includes thorough data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development processes. The model achieved an R² value of 81%, <br>
indicating strong predictive power.<br>


**DataSet:**<br>
The dataset used in this project is a sample extracted from a larger dataset. It includes various features relevant to taxi fare predictions, such as:<br>
Pickup datetime<br>
Dropoff datetime<br>
Pickup location<br>
Dropoff location<br>
Passenger count<br>
Trip distance<br>
Fare amount<br>


**Data Cleaning:**<br>
Data cleaning steps included:<br>
Handling missing values.<br>
Feature engineering.<br>


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**<br>
EDA was performed to visualize key trends and patterns in the data. This included:<br>
Distribution plots for numerical features.<br>
Correlation analysis.<br>
Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.<br>


**Model Development:**<br>
A linear regression model was developed and fine-tuned to predict taxi fares. The key steps included:<br>
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.<br>
Training the model on the training data.<br>
Evaluating the model on the test data.<br>


**Results:**<br>
The model achieved an R² value of 81%, indicating strong predictive power. This demonstrates the model's ability to explain a significant portion of the<br>
variance in the target variable.


**Future improvements could include:**<br>
Incorporating additional features for better prediction accuracy.<br>
Exploring more complex machine learning algorithms.<br>
Scaling the model to handle larger datasets.<br>
